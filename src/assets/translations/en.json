My main responsibility involved developing screens in Angular, initially working with version 7 and later migrating to Angular 13. Throughout this process, I utilized libraries such as Angular Material and also implemented custom libraries to meet specific client requirements. Additionally, I undertook the execution of unit tests using Jasmine and Karma.<br>The project was structured with an architecture comprising a front-end part developed in Angular, a small front-end back-end in .Net, and the complete back-end also in .Net. Within the front-end back-end, I worked with translations and API calls.<br>In the project, we followed Agile methodologies and worked in monthly sprints controlled by the Azure DevOps platform. Moreover, we utilized Git as a code repository, facilitating project management and version control.",
